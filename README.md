# Charlotte LAN
Charlotte LAN was created in the Network Based Application Development course by me ([Caden Lalley](https://github.com/cadenlalley)) at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The purpose of this web application is to allow people to organize and host different LAN gaming tournaments in the Charlotte area. It is built using Express (Node.js) and MongoDB.
